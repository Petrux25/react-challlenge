# How to run

This project was developed using the latest version of yarn. To run this project please install yarn 2.

1. Run `npm install -g yarn` to update the global yarn version to latest v1
2. cd into the project and do `yarn start`

I'm using yarn PnP so there is **no need** to run `yarn install`
